"This project aims to build a predictive model that can classify the 'classe' variable in a sensor dataset based on motion and activity measurements. Using the Random Forest algorithm, known to be effective in handling large and complex data, the process begins by cleaning the data from missing values ​​and irrelevant columns. Next, the data is divided into two sets: training and testing, to ensure a more accurate model evaluation. The trained model is evaluated using a confusion matrix, which provides an overview of the model's accuracy and predictive ability in classifying previously unseen data. Through this approach, the project successfully optimizes the prediction accuracy and provides a solution for automatic classification that can be applied to various sensor-based systems."
